# About this Repository
This repository is a derivative work of the [APEX Sample Customers](https://github.com/oracle/apex/tree/22.1/starter-apps/customers) Application designed to demonstrate the alignment to the [Oracle APEX Application Development Lifecycle Technical Paper](https://apex.oracle.com/go/lifecycle-technical-paper).

This repository is used by the "Oracle APEX CI/CD: Step-by-step guide aligned to the Application Lifecycle Technical Paper" blog on [Hot off the Application Express](https://mattmulvaney.hashnode.dev). It's recommended that you read that blog.

It also includes

* Logger v3.1.1
* Cypress

The following modifications have been made
* DB Objects scraped from DB & placed in to **\src**
* Using utilities from [Lifecycle Technical Paper files](https://apex.oracle.com/go/lifecycle-technical-paper-files) specifically
 * Custom version of **apexexport2git** to export APEX + DB + Workspace
 * Custom version of **git2buildzip**, which built **\build\sample_customers_0000.zip** (open zip file to see what's zipped)
* Liquibase Changesets created by SQLcl 23.1 for...
  * DB objects & placed in to **\database**
  * Data & placed in to **\data**
  * Sample data reversed from login Process & added to **\changelogs**

  * Reordering of install.sql to avoid deploy conflicts introduced SQLcl 23.1 
  * Removal of [storage/tablespace information](https://twitter.com/Matt_Mulvaney/status/1648961169678381057) introduced in SQLcl 23.1 

# Logger v3.1.1
Source: https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger

Attribution: https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger/graphs/contributors

Logger is not actually used in the Sample Customer Application, however its been tested and included as a proof of concept of the other_schemas capability 

The following modifications have been made

* Provided Logger as a other_schema (logger_user) by using SQLcl genschema to convert into Liquibase Changesets 
* Initial logger-data.xml provided & included in the controller.xml

## Use in other Project Repositories
**\object_grant** scripts are provided to grant to SAMPLE_CUSTOMERS schema used in this project. Attempts were made to find the [SQLcl LB Substitution pairs](https://twitter.com/Matt_Mulvaney/status/1648274980709203974 ) to parameterise this, however there is no ability to currently set these, not even in the defaults-file.
